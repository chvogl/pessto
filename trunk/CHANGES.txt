v1.0, 20120420 -- Initial release.
------
v1.1, 20120601 -- changes:

-  date of observation is now fixed to the night of observation also for observation after the mid-night. If an object is observed in two consecutive nights (after midnight in the first night and before midnight during the second night ) and pre-reduced in two different folders will now different names. Multiple exposure during the same night will have a different name 'name_1,name_2,ecc'

- all the iraf task are now unlearned before using them in order to don't use personal user iraf setting.
- SOFI spectra re-extraction is skiped (using option -A) if the extraction was performed before.  
- aperture informations from database/ directory added to the tar file
- sofi photometry:  sky image added to the header as "skysub"
- if header stdname not present in the standard file (reduced outside the pipeline), sens function crash, warning needed  DONE
- unlearn task warning in efoscspec1d to be checked      DONE
- the mask pylab plot on/off freeze on centos            DONE

- add A-B information in sofi spectrum (probably in the header as "skysub")  DONE
- reduce standard alone if object not available          DONE
- add a .list file with all raw data used to the tar     DONE
- zeropoint landolt filters in sloan field to be check   DONE
- question on extracting the spectrum again, not working any more   DONE 
- adding JD_reduction in the names                       DONE
- adding filetype keyword in the reduced files           DONE
- question on shift (to be removed in not interactive way)  DONE
- readkey divided in readhdr (to read the header) and readkey3 to connect to hierarch keywords (speed up a lot starting list)
- range spectra included
- sofi images combination performed with swarp
- 2d SOFI flux calibrated spectra
- weight mask
- TRACE,PROV   added
- limit magnitude                        DONE
- MJD-END                                DONE
- saturation level                       DONE
- S/N					 DONE
- mbkg sofi images fixed from sky image  DONE

v1.1.3b, 20120920 -- changes:

-  weight mask added using swarp
-  pyfits.writeto write 32bit file  using numpy.float32
-  cosmic correction added with lacos
-  sofi arc now obtained as lamp ON - lamp OFF
-  fixed residual in SOFI images, masking was not applied


Next bugs/changes to be fixed:
* strange continuum on sky dimension, to be checked
- infrared sofi flux (wrong scale)  DONE
- header for phase 3 	    	    DONE
- updateheader  takes now a dictionary  

v2.0.0  -changes:
- working now with pyfits-3.0
- last header for phase 3 added
- query catalogue, now use vizquery


v2.2.1 -changes to correct ESO realse
- add this line to make working with iraf 2.16 
  iraf.ccdred.instrument = "/dev/null" 
- removed all this keywords ?
   PC1_1 PC1_2 PC2_2 
- change reference in the header
util.py:            'REFERENC':['Smartt et al 2014','Bibliographic reference']
- change way how mag limit is computed 
maglim=_ZP -2.5 * log10( _sn/(_gain*_exptime) * (npix*(_mbkg*_gain)+(EFFRON**2)*npix)**(1./2.) )
- change saturation mag 
magsat=-2.5*math.log10(  (math.pi/(4*math.log(2.)))*(60000.-float(mbkg3))*((float(fwhmgess3)/0.24)**2)  )
- change step in the wavelength calibration check from 1 A to .1 A
- CDELT 1 CDELT2   commented 
- problem   'ABMAGLIM = INF.0'  solved 
-  SOFI images  Ncombine set to only images on source 
- SPEC_SYE set to 1

- cut header longer than 68

- compute EFFRON twice (also in the lim mag, since lim mag if computed before EFFRON and EFFRON keyword is still not update when limit is computed

- efosc sensitivity function updated
- sofi flat fields updated
- using SDSS DR9 instead of DR7
- added interactive zeropoint to PESSTOASTRO
- added interactive astrometry to PESSTOASTRO
